Hi, my name is Hokie Lopez and I am a recent college graduate from the University of Virginia. I studied Computer Science and have a passion for creating software that makes people's lives better.

In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, running, and traveling. I have been to several countries in Europe and Asia and hope to visit many more in the future.

I am currently looking for job opportunities as a software developer. I am a fast learner and am excited to continue learning and growing as a developer.

Thank you for visiting my website. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. I would love to hear from you.

Best regards,

Hokie Lopez
